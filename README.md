# Deep-Learning
A set of notes and code snippets to help me understand neural networks and their implementations

Currently done:
- Neural network from scratch (using numpy) along with a pdf explaining backpropogation in mathematical detail

Working on:
- Understanding and implementing convolutional and pooling layers
