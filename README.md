# Deep-Learning
A set of notes and code snippets to help me understand neural networks and their implementations

Currently done:
- Neural network from scratch (using numpy) along with a pdf explaining backpropogation in mathematical detail
- Alexnet implementaion

Working on:
- Understanding and implementing convolutional and pooling layers, writing notes
- Conv net architectures:
  - alexnet (done) https://github.com/AditMeh/deep-learning/blob/main/AlexNet.ipynb
  - resnet
  - FCNN
  - Fast R-CNN
  - Faster R-CNN
